Manga chapter downloader for [Batoto](https://bato.to/)

**NOTE: currently broken**

Built last year but they have shifted to a login system.

Tested on Python 2.7.10

Haven't had time to fix or polish it up. The Requests library should be more than able to
handle the login.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Run `python run.py` from the command line
At the prompt, paste the **URL** of the series.
Choose from the list of chapters available.

Downloads will be in `~/Manga/`
e.g. `~/Manga/mycoolestnewestmanga/ch1`

Just some parting thoughts as this project holds a special place in my soul..

This was my first real foray into a project. No tutorial, no videos, no instructions. 
It was just a problem I felt I could I could solve with code.
I couldn't afford a very good internet connection so this was born out of my need to read high quality manga in peace (NOT in pieces). 
It felt like a waste of time to sit there while a page loads and/or opening several tabs saving/or saving each image (via right-clicking) one by one to read later.
The ones I tried didn't work that well so I just built my own.

Looking back, the sheer breadth of what you learn from your very first time is amazing.
The amount of respect I have for programmers I gained during that ordeal, as well as my own satisfaction with myself, is something that I'll never forget.

It still kind of strikes me as unbelievable when I had no idea and just learned and figured pretty much everything along the way.

If anyone is just starting out and is doubting themselves. Hang in there. It will begin to start clicking. Expert coders have probably failed more times than you have attempted.

But it's definitely worth it.
